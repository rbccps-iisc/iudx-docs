Follow
======

* **Summary**: The follow API is a data exchange enabling API that is used to express interest in another entity's data. It could either be for reading, writing, or both. It is time-bound and the requestor has to explicitly mention the duration for which they would like to the data. Once the follow request is made, the ``follow-status`` API can be queried to check if the follow request is approved by the requested device.
